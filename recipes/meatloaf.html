    <p>Making meatloaf is a simple, homey process that turns basic ingredients into a hearty, comforting dish.</p>
    <p>It usually starts with ground meat—most often beef, or a mix of beef and pork—placed in a bowl. Breadcrumbs or crushed crackers are added to help bind everything together and keep the loaf tender. An egg goes in next, along with milk or broth, which adds moisture. Chopped onion and garlic bring flavor, while salt, pepper, and seasonings like paprika or herbs give it warmth and depth. A splash of ketchup or Worcestershire sauce is often mixed in for a savory, slightly tangy note.</p>
    <p>Once everything is combined, the mixture is gently blended by hand until just mixed—overworking it can make the meatloaf dense. The meat is then shaped into a loaf or pressed into a pan. A layer of ketchup or a sweet-and-savory glaze is spread over the top, which will caramelize as it cooks.</p>
    <p>The meatloaf bakes in the oven until it’s cooked through, filling the kitchen with a rich, comforting aroma. After resting for a few minutes, it’s sliced and served, tender and flavorful, often alongside mashed potatoes or vegetables.</p>
