    <h2>The Recipe</h2>
    <p>Spaghetti carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish known for its rich, comforting flavors and simple ingredients.
         Traditionally made with spaghetti, eggs, Pecorino Romano cheese, cured pork such as guanciale, and freshly cracked black pepper, 
         the dish relies on technique rather than heavy sauces. The pasta is cooked until al dente, while the pork is rendered slowly 
         until crisp, releasing flavorful fat. A mixture of eggs and finely grated cheese is prepared separately, forming the base of the sauce that will coat the pasta.</p>

    <p>Once the spaghetti is drained, it is combined with the hot pork and a small amount of reserved pasta water. The pan is removed from the heat before the egg and cheese mixture is stirred in, allowing the residual warmth to create a silky, creamy sauce without scrambling the eggs. A generous sprinkle of black pepper finishes the dish.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul><li>6 oz guanciale</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 egg yolks</li>
        <li>4 oz parmigiano reggiano</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>14oz spaghetti</li>
        <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol><li><strong>Guanciale</strong> - Cut into fifth inch thick slices then into batons.</li>
        <li><strong>Carbonara sauce</strong> - Place eggs and yolks in a large bowl. Whisk to combine. Then stir in the parmesan and pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook Pasta</strong> - Bring 4 litres (4 quarts) of water to the boil with the salt. Add pasta and cook per the packet directions.</li>
        <li><strong>Reserve pasta water</strong>– Just before draining, scoop out 1 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook guanciale</strong>– While the pasta is cooking, place guanciale in a non stick pan over medium high heat. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes until golden. No oil needed – as the guanciale heats up, the fat will melt so it fries in its own fat. If using garlic, add it in the last minute.</li>
        <li><strong>Pasta in pan</strong>– Tip the hot pasta into the pan and toss to coat in guanciale fat.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix pasta in sauce</strong>– Transfer the pasta and any residual fat in the pan into the bowl with the egg. Add 1/2 cup (125 ml) pasta cooking water. Stir vigorously using the handle of a wooden spoon for 1 minute and watch as the sauce transforms from watery to creamy and clings to the pasta strands!</li>
        <li><strong>Serve</strong>Transfer into warm bowls. Serve immediately, garnished with a little extra parmigiana reggiano if desired, and a pinch of black pepper and finely chopped parsley.</li>
    </ol>
